# tree is a non linear data structure.

# tree contains set of nodes contains parent child relationship.

# tree and child are connected using "edges.."

# number of noes="N".
# number of edges="N-1"

# the top node of the tree is called "root".
# nodes in the same level is called "sibbling.." but should have same parent.

# nodes at the end of the tree is called "leaf nodes./external nodes." (which are having no children.)

# path is defined as a trace drawn from root node to leaf node uniquly..

# "FOREST" when the root of tree is removed all the children become seperate  tree then they are called forest.

# ...........................heoghts and levels.............
# the root of the tree is called height 0 or level 1..
# height describes as the number of edges to the level..
# level indicates the number of number of the level of nodes  down below.
# ................degree of a node.............
            #    degree of a node is the number of childen of the node..

# degree of the tree is the maximum degree of the node.
